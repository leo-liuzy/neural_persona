Re-run model on training data which exclude the document which contains evaluation peoples
Run the nyt-parse with stanford parser which was suspended somehow
Run the wikidata query again for the 13,000+ mid
write visualization code

09-25
run evaluation of experiments with three different early stopping criteria -- d_npmi, e_npmi, loss

09-27
correctly split data, dev set only consists of documents having gold clustered entities. Previouisly, some of the gold clustered entities are in train set, there for dev set are not big enough. 
Rerun the experiments on basic ladder

it shows that the previously thought good result are erroneous, since the metric -- variation of information and purity score -- we use are partially dependent on the amount of entities.

Found experiments with loss as stopping criteria are runned incorrectly, rerunning it. I was afraid that the model does not need dropout, as there may not be such need to avoid overfitting. Therefore, I rerun the experiments without dropout

10-06
read papers on representation learning

10-07
run basic-namefree with loss
run basic-namefree-nodropout
create synthetic dataset

10-08
run on synthetic dataset, but observe negative npmi
create another penalty terms for document level divergence
run the basic-l-div models

10-09
run evalutation on toy model
run evaluation on basic-l-nodropout model
decide on naming convention and rename all files
add if condition in bash script so that metric can be set automatically

10-10
run evaluation on toy experiments
run toy experiments with doc_div linear_annealing to be 2000
waiting movies_div6000 to finish

10-17
design vampire_persona model, which is just topic model trained on entity_as_doc corpus and decompose the "topic model"
run vampire_persona model

10-20
finish and run the gumbel VAE to model "bamman generative model"
expectedly the result won't look good
re-run vampire_persona model in that models were not saved due to insufficient storage space.
change to sync data with github, this is a trivial/obvious choice that's overlooked before. From now on, only data transmition will go through scp.

10-21
run clustering method on the vampire_persona  and gumbel-VAE model
