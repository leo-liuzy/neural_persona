run evaluation metric on nyt-dataset
run david's model on nyt-dataset
try with david model but with more 2 hops in dependency tree

create and run on synthetic data

use dense feature by using sentence embedders(e.g. BERT, ELMo) to encode sentences in a document rather than using BoW features which does not seems promising.
Still, run the gumbel-VAE model with bamman's preprocessed features.
